# Premiumize.me CLI Downloader
A simple script, using premiumize.me's undocumented web API to decrypt DLCs, downloading files and extracting them.

The script was created, since pyload is currently not working when using `uploaded.to` links with `premiumize.me` accounts and I wanted to download files directly to my server without going through my personal computer.

## Usage
Invoke the script using `./premiumize-cli-downloader.sh <Links.dlc>`. The files will be stored in the current working directory alongside with two temporary files, unless you specified a default download location in your configuration file. After the download finished, the files (if they are a rar archive) will be extracted into the directory and the downloaded archives, as well as the temp files and the DLC will be deleted.

Alternatively the script can be invoked with a `.links` file, where each line starts with the URL of the download links.

If no argument is given, the script will scan the current directory for `*.dlc` and `*.links` file and process them.

Optionally the `-e` flag can be provided and will open `vim` before starting the download, giving you the opportunity to delete unwanted files from the download list.

Additionally failed download links -either due to problems getting the premium link or problems during the download - will be stored in a `premiumize.<PID>.failed.links` file, which can be used with this script to retry the download. If the `-r` flag is given, the script will retry downloading failed files until success.

Currently the script only grabs download links from `uploaded.to`, modify the `get_premium_link` function to change this behaviour. Similiarily only rar archives are currently support (see the `extract_files` function).

## Configuration
I recommend cloning the repository into `/opt/`. In order to configure the script, move or copy the `premiumize-cli-downloader.conf.example` to `/opt/premiumize-cli-downloader.conf` and enter your User ID and PIN (both can be obtained from your profile on the premiumize.me webpage). If you choose to move the application to a different location modify the `source` command in [line 3](https://github.com/steilerDev/premiumize.me-cli-downloader/blob/master/premiumize-cli-downloader.sh#L3).

You can specify a default download location in this file, by setting the variable `$DEFAULT_DOWNLOAD_LOCATION`. Multiple parallel downloads are possible as well, set the variable `$MAX_PARALLEL_DL` in your config script to an integer that fits your needs.

# Prerequisits
The script only requires `curl` (version: 7.26.0) for the web interactions, `jq` (version: jq-1.4-1-e73951f) for JSON processing and `unrar` (version 4.10) for extraction. I tested the script with the annotated versions on a Debian 8 machine, that does not mean that they are explicitly required. Additionally `savelog` is used for a rotating log file, check if your machine can use this mechanism (otherwise you will get an error and all your logs will be put into a single file).
